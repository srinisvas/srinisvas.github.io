# Hi, I'm Srinivasan Subramanian

Technical Lead with 11 years of experience designing and delivering large scale enterprise systems, cloud modernization programs, resilient integration platforms, and mission critical data pipelines. My work spans modernization of legacy systems, engineering fault tolerant architectures, building secure B2B integrations, and enabling high throughput transaction processing across global retail ecosystems.

My core strength is bridging legacy enterprise systems with modern cloud native architectures. I have spent my career leading transformations that replaced fragile on premise stacks with scalable, observable, automation driven platforms deployed on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Google Cloud.

## What I Build

### Enterprise Integration Platforms
- Modernized EDI ecosystems from IBM Gentran to IBM B2B Integrator  
- Automated partner onboarding using IBM Partner Engagement Manager  
- Operational visibility with IBM Control Center  
- Integrated VAN services for secure partner communication  
- Delivered fault tolerant, highly available B2B flows at scale  

### Cloud Modernization & Distributed Systems
- Migrated Java services from Tomcat Grid to PCF  
- Built scalable APIs and integration layers  
- Designed MFT solutions for secure, high volume file movement  
- Engineered event driven systems with Kafka, MQ, RabbitMQ  
- Created CI/CD pipelines enabling zero downtime deployments  

### Data Engineering & Pipelines
- Apache Beam and Dataflow based pipelines  
- BigQuery to Pub/Sub streaming systems  
- Multi stage analytical transformations  
- Cross database processing and orchestration  

### GenAI & Applied AI (Secondary Focus)
While my foundation is enterprise software engineering, I also build applied AI systems including:
- RAG powered agents using Vertex AI and Gemini  
- Supplier facing EDI understanding agents  
- Privacy preserving retrieval architectures  
- Research in FL, DP, FHE, accelerated RAG
