# Research Overview

Although my primary focus is enterprise software engineering and modernization, I actively pursue research in applied AI security, retrieval optimization, and privacy preserving machine learning.

My research interests include:

- Federated Learning security  
- Adversarial attacks and defense methods  
- Differential privacy in ranking systems  
- FHE encrypted similarity search  
- Retrieval augmented generation optimization  
- Sparse activation summarization  
- Safe inference and agent analysis
