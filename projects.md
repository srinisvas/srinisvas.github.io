# Software Engineering Projects

### GenAI Agent Platform for Enterprise Integration Knowledge
- Built agentic GenAI solutions on Google Vertex AI using Gemini as the foundation model to enable self-service access to enterprise integration knowledge.
- Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector search over embedded EDI specifications, XML schemas, and technical documents.
- Extended the solution to a multi-agent architecture using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), with specialized agents for X12 generation, data validation, and partner configuration workflows.

### Cloud-Native Supplier Data Platform
- Designed and developed a scalable API platform to expose supplier master data to downstream consumers across enterprise systems.
- Built Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) services in Java to optimize frontend-backend interactions and support UI-specific requirements.
- Implemented secure, event-driven microservices using Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, and message queues, applying pub/sub and CQRS patterns.

### Data Pipelines and Streaming Architecture
- Developed cloud data pipelines using Google Cloud Dataflow and Apache Beam to ingest data from multiple sources, apply transformations, and publish processed data to downstream systems.
- Implemented pipelines to replicate on-premises data from legacy databases such as Oracle and DB2 to cloud platforms including BigQuery and Cloud SQL.
- Enabled real-time and near real-time data processing through event-driven and streaming architectures.

### Enterprise Integration and Modernization
- Led modernization of EDI and B2B integration platforms, migrating from legacy gateways to modern, cloud-enabled EDI solutions.
- Built resiliency and integration layers around enterprise platforms to improve fault tolerance and system availability.
- Implemented financial messaging and payment workflows aligned with ISO 20022 standards.
